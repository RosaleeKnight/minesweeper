# minesweeper

Making the minesweeper game using only css which I read about as a challenge in a coding magazine. This is my first project using SCSS. The idea is to have an interactive game that keep track of your flags and bombs left to find. Some of the challenges I faced in this challenge is using correct nesting, how to run scss via extension in visual studio and then converting SCSS to CSS to link over. I also learned how much you can do with CSS or SCSS but there are also limits such as the random number value; as soon as the CSS is processed the randomization is over and the number is locked unlike with JavaScript. It was a difficult but enjoyable experience. :)
