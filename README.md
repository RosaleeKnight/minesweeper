# minesweeper

Making the minesweeper game using only css which I read about as a challenge in a coding magazine. This is my first project using SCSS. The idea is to have an interactive game that keep track of your flags and bombs left to find. Some of the challenges I faced in this challenge is using correct nesting, how to run scss via extention in visual studio and then converting SCSS to CSS to link over. It was a difficult but enjoyable experience. :)
