# minesweeper

Making the minesweeper game using only css which I read about as a challenge in a coding magazine. This is my first project using a SCSS file. The idea is to have an interactive game that keep track of your flags and bombs left to find. Some of the challenges I faced in this challenge is using correct nesting, how to run scss via extention in visual studio and then... 

used a JSON formatter to create a css file to put it all together...

that broke the code... :(
